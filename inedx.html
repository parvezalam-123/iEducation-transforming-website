            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small ">Education in India is primarily managed by the state-run public
                education system, which falls under the command of the government at three levels: central, state and
                local.Under various articles of the Indian Constitution and the Right of
                Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009, free and compulsory education is provided as a
                fundamental right to children aged 6 to 14. The approximate ratio of the total number of public schools
                to private schools in India is
                10:3.Education in India covers different levels and types of learning, such as early childhood
                education, primary education, secondary education, higher education, and vocational education. It varies
                significantly according to different
                factors, such as location (urban or rural), gender, caste, religion, language, and disability.The
                pre-primary stage is the foundation of children's knowledge, skills and behaviour. On completion of
                pre-primary education, the children are
                sent to the primary stage, but pre-primary education in India is not a fundamental right. In rural
                India, pre-primary schools are rarely available in small villages. But in cities and big towns, there
                are many established players in the
                pre-primary education sector. The demand for the preschools is growing considerably in the smaller towns
                and cities but still, only 1% of the population under age 6 is enrolled in preschool education.

            <p class="sectiontag text-big ">Transforming Education in India</p>
            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small ">Up until 1976, under the Indian constitution, school education was a
                state subject; states possessed full jurisdiction over making and implementing education policies. After
                the 42nd Amendment of the Constitution of India was passed in 1976,
                education fell under the concurrent list.This allowed the central government to recommend education
                policies and programmes, even if state governments continued to wield extensive autonomy in implementing
                these programmes.In a country
                as large as India, now with 28 states and eight union territories, this has created vast differences
                between states in terms of their policies, plans, programmes and initiatives relating to school
                education. Periodically, national policy
                frameworks are created to guide states in their creation of state-level programmes and policies.State
                governments and local government bodies manage the majority of primary and upper primary schools and the
                number of government-managed
                elementary schools is growing. Simultaneously the number and proportion managed by private bodies is
                growing. In 2005-6 83.13% of schools offering elementary education (Grades 1–8) were managed by
                government and 16.86% of schools were
                under private management (excluding children in unrecognised schools, schools established under the
                Education Guarantee Scheme and in alternative learning centres). Of those schools managed privately, one
                third are 'aided' and two thirds
                are 'unaided'. Enrolment in Grades 1–8 is shared between government and privately managed schools in the
                ratio 73:27. However, in rural areas this ratio is higher (80:20) and in urban areas much lower (36:66).

            <p class="sectiontag text-big ">Lets Grow Together</p>
            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small ">Demand for private schools has been growing over the years.While a
                consensus over what is the most significant driver of this growth in private schooling has not yet
                emerged, some authors have attributed this to a higher demand for English-medium
                education, a dissatisfaction with the quality of public schools,greater affordability of private
                schools,[19] and non-availability of preferred field of study in government schools.[23] After the
                adoption of the Right to Education (RTE)
                Act 2009, private schools were required to be 'government-recognised'. A private school would be
                eligible for government recognition when it met certain conditions.At the primary and secondary level,
                India has a large private school system
                complementing the government run schools, with 29% of students receiving private education in the 6 to
                14 age group.Certain post-secondary technical schools are also private. The private education market in
                India had a revenue of US$450
                million in 2008, but is projected to be a US$40 billion market.</p>
